              14.1 No partnership or agency The Terms of Use shall not be
              construed so as to create a partnership or joint venture between
              you and us. Nothing in the Terms of Use shall be construed so as
              to constitute you and us as agents of one another.
            </p>
            <p>
              14.2 Specific Performance Each one of us agrees that damages may
              not be an adequate remedy and that either of us shall be entitled
              to an injunction, restraining order, right for recovery, suit for
              specific performance, or such other equitable relief as a court of

              restrain the other, from committing any violation or enforce the
              performance of the covenants, representations, and obligations
              contained in the Terms of Use. These injunctive remedies are
              cumulative and are in addition to any other rights and remedies

              enforceable as such in the event of any obligation or obligations
              being or becoming unenforceable in whole or in part. To the extent
              that any provision or provisions of the Terms of Use are
              unenforceable, both of us shall endeavour to amend such clauses as
              may be necessary to make the provision or provisions valid and
              effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision which
              cannot be amended as may be necessary to make it valid and
              effective shall be deemed to be deleted from the Terms of Use and
              any such deletion shall not affect the enforceability of the
              remainder of the Terms of Use not so deleted provided the
              fundamental terms of the Terms of Use are not altered.
            </p>

              in equity. The rights and remedies of any of us based upon,
              arising out of or otherwise in respect of any inaccuracy or breach
              of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or failure
              to fulfil any condition shall in no way be limited by the fact
              that the act, omission, occurrence or another state of facts upon
              which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach is based may also
              be the subject matter of any other representation, warranty,
              covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or
              breach.

              14.5 Partial Invalidity If any provision of the Terms of Use or
              the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall be
              invalid or unenforceable to any extent for any reason including by
              reason of any law or regulation or government policy, the
              remainder of the Terms of Use and the application of such
              provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which
              it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby,
              and each provision of the Terms of Use shall be valid and
              enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Any invalid or
              unenforceable provision of the Terms of Use shall be replaced with
              a provision, which is valid and enforceable and most nearly
              reflects the original intent of the invalid and unenforceable
              provision.
